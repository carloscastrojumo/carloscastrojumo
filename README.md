## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a System Development Engineer specialised in Cloud environments, CI/CD and general automation. My focus is to facilitate the developers by providing them tools and processes to speed up their work. This includes IaC, CI/CD pipelines, observability, security and compliance. Before that, I was a former Software Engineer working with microservices, event driven architecture.

Currently @ [JUMO](https://jumo.world/)
